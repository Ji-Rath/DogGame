Things to talk about:

- Stair mechanic (Easier if stairs were in the 'forward' direction)
- Features to focus on (for end-of-year deadline)
- Battle Mechanic Status (Juicy effects, transitions, new attacks for other enemies, 
	post-minigame cutscene, etc)
- Future animations (SlideShow? Maybe with voice narration can work)
- Main Scene mechanics (Houses with 2 floors, entering a house, etc)
- 


- fade in fade out transitions
- Animation style is meant to be a bit janky or unsmooth
- rocket kid should be able to 'block' minigames

Work Deadline:
- Speed of minigames will depend on the stage - which is based on health (Increase the speed of minigames/timers )
- chip game - each chip heals, should have indicator (Bigger chips)
- When enemy takes damage, show imediate feedback to prevent waiting time (for all attacks)
- Pan minigame - increase pan weight and size

- Multiple enemies (Player attacks, all enemies attack after)
- when crab is low, call in reinforcements
- Add new minigames if possible

- Reduce crab physics size
- Make every physics object heavier
- Fix being able to grab multiple physics objects
- Redo anvil minigame so dp is trapped, after he breaks free, drag dp out of harms way
- Adjust minigame speed so transitions and timers can be sped up based on a value?


NOTES 2:

- Speed up transitions (From player pressing button, to pan attack) (DONE)
- Move button interaction to points of interest (ex. button near dp on anvil game) (DONE)
- Remove anvil damage from crab (DONE)
- Rope physics (Kindof DONE)
- streamlining sequences for simple implementation (when completing a minigame) (Kindof DONE)
- 


- Talk about running minigames through console
- Talk about sequences being run in game through the console
- Talk about the console in general
- Talk about rope mechanics


For anvil rope rescue, create rope explosion and transition sprite to freed position
dp anvil when struggling will be alternating between sprites
edit end-game minigame so sequence plays out fully then minigame ends (DONE)
Changed minigame screen to allow for sequences to be played (DONE)

work on new minigames (rope minigame)

- Top left buttons can be pressed during chip minigame
