What I want to complete:

Reorganize battle scene:
- Battle Move: Randomized game to give the player a chance to attack the enemy?
	If successful, deal damage to enemy.
	After, go to enemy turn
- Item Move: A predefined game to give the player a status effect?
	If successful, give status effect and increase timer.
	After, player gets another turn
- Book move: A minigame to give a negative status effect to the enemy?
	If successful, enemy becomes vulnerable.
	After, player gets another turn

Player Stats:

HealthPoints: The current health of the character
PowerPoints: Points to spend on ultimate move?
Confidence?: Affects how strong the players attacks are
